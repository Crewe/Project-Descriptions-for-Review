# Multi-User Blog: Project Overview

A basic blog application, written in Python.

---

### How do I complete this project? 

1. Install and configure [Python](https://www.python.org/) on your computer.
2. Work through the lessons in the [associated course](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-backend--ud171).
3. By the end of the course, you'll have a functional but incomplete blog application. You're tasked with making the following changes to it:
    * Users should be able to edit their posts
    * Users can "like" posts, but only once and not their own
    * Users can comment on posts and edit their comments
4. Double-check that your project meets our [rubric specifications](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/7508498640/rubric).
5. [Submit it](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/150/start)!

### Things to look out for

* Always be sure to store passwords securely.
* Watch out for the evils of [XSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting#Safely_validating_untrusted_HTML_input)!
* When you're making changes to your blog app, you might have to clear [App Engine's cache](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/console/#memcache) now and then.

### Making your app stand out

There are a bunch of ways to improve your blog once the basic features are implemented! Consider: 

1. Styling your blog using CSS, and play around with a framework like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) or [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com).
2. Make your blog grab profile pictures for users via their [Gravatar email](https://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/).
3. Consider extra features, such as a "dislike" button or tools for sharing posts to social media websites!
