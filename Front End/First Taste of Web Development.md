# Project Submission

Now that you’ve learned about the history of Front End Development, and where you stand in that evolving story, it's time you take your first dive into this amazing world! You'll be creating your very own store front. We'll be providing you with some starter code and walk you through adding HTML content, styling it with CSS, and adding interactivity with JavaScript.

# Project Instructions

This project will use an in-browser code editor. We'll provide you with an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file to edit. All three files will come with some pre-written code, but they're not quite complete… yet. It'll be your job to add the remaining code to the files to complete the project! But don’t worry, we'll be either giving you the code you need to write or guiding you on how to write it yourself. Feel free to experiment with some of the code that's in these files, just make sure that if you make a change and things seem to break, that you undo your changes.

# Project Evaluation

Once you've completed the project, it will be sent off to be reviewed by our fantastic team of reviewers. Even though the majority of the code is provided to you, you'll still submit this project for review so you can get experience with how Udacity reviews projects and what to expect from the kind of feedback we provide.

**Note: This project does contain some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that is either not accurate or written to professional standards. This has been done purposefully, so after your project is reviewed, you'll receive some feedback on how you could've coded things better. Remember that this is just a practice project... the other projects in the Nanodegree program will not set you up with hidden errors!**
